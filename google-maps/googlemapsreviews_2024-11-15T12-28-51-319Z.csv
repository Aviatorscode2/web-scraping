ReedH,Pretty solid slice shop on the west side! Maybe a little inconsistent in terms of crispness of the crust - my first slice was absolutely perfect but the second one could have done with a bit more time in the oven. Lots of cheese and pretty good toppings though. I’d come back.,a month ago,4

David Cunningham,First or second best slice pizza in the hood.  Price per slice has gotten outrageously high; but I still go back because it’s better than anything else nearby (Mam’a Too is farther from me).  Spicy pepperoni is their signature; but they also have maybe my favorite plain cheese slice in the city.,a month ago,5

Mer P,Wow! Love this neighborhood spot. It’s consistently full and the pizza is great. For me; the Sicilian slices are better than the regular.

Jose Delgado,Excellent Pizza by the slice with many options. Pizza has a delicious crust that snaps at every bite. Cheese and sauce are well balanced and the toppings are generous.

Shakil Mirza,It’s an ok pizza for $5.50 a slice; the chicken (not pictured) is really flavourful. But two flaws; 1) too much crust and 2) too hard to chew for a thin crust. I prefer Joes Pizza.,a year ago,4
Leonardo Torres,The crust was firm and crunchy. The sauce and cheese were of good quality.  The spicy pepperoni was well seasoned and flavorful.  This pie may be more akin to a Detroit style but I can proudly state that it's "Made in New York.",3 years ago,5

Roy Treiyer,Good variety of pizza. I only had a plain slice. The crust was good; but the cheese wasn't the best (mainly the texture; probably due to the quantity).
